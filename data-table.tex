\textbf{Data attributes} &
\textbf{Financial portfolios} &
\textbf{Ecological portfolios} &
\textbf{What this means for ecological portfolios}\\

\midrule

Interdependence &
A diverse portfolio is unlikely to have strong dependence between assets &
Populations may be strongly impacted by changes in other populations of the same species (e.g. competition or migration) or other species (e.g. predation) &
Interactions needs to be accounted for; forecasts may be less reliable\\

Measurement error &
Reported asset value is the true value that impacts an investor &
Recorded data typically includes substantial measurement error and may be biased &
Uncertainty needs to be propagated through analyses\\

Frequency and duration &
High frequency (e.g. seconds), regular recording intervals, missing values rare, long durations &
Lower frequency (often years), sometimes irregular recording intervals, missing values common, often short durations &
Might be less certain in the optimal solution for ecological systems; time-series methods require unique approach (e.g. autocorrelation different)\\

Synchrony &
Relatively low synchrony for diversified portfolios &
Relatively high synchrony for similar populations or species; potential asynchrony due to species interactions &
Potentially less benefit from portfolio diversification; species interactions could lead to different dynamics than in financial portfolios\\

Mean-variance scaling &
Variation scales directly with investment &
Variation may scale non-linearly with investment if asset size is considered the level of investment &
The mean-variance relationship needs to be accounted for\\

Number of assets &
Typically unlimited; generally high &
Typically limited; generally low &
Potentially less opportunity for portfolio diversification\\
