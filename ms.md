# Abstract

In the next 100 years, we face unprecedented losses of biodiversity,
unparallelled rates of climatic change, and uncertainty about the ecological
response to these conditions. Combined, these issues call for ways to
communicate the problems and solutions, ways to measure our progress and
compare systems, and ways to robustly prioritize conservation. Recent work has
proposed the ecological portfolio concept as one important solution. Here, we
review this work and show how ecological portfolios have been used as
*metaphors* for the benefit of biological diversity, *metrics* to compare the
benefits of diversification across systems and through time, and *management
tools* to make optimal conservation conservation decisions in the face of
environmental uncertainty. We link ecological portfolios with existing
ecological theory and demonstrate that the portfolio concept can unite many
aspects of existing theory. We highlight challenges posed by both imprecision
in the metaphor and fundamental differences between financial and ecological
data. We emphasize the tremendous opportunity to apply portfolio optimization
to conservation planning and introduce how financial risk metrics could benefit
ecology. We conclude by outlining key questions for ecological portfolio theory
to address.

# Introduction

In the coming century we face a loss of biodiversity on the order of
100--10,000 times greater than average rates in the fossil record
[@mea2005] --- a rate as fast if not faster than any of the five past
mass extinctions [@barnosky2011]. Compounding this problem for ecological
resource managers is uncertainty in future climate conditions [@heller2009]
and the unknown responses of species and communities to those conditions
[@lavergne2010]. Therefore, urgent questions are: Exactly how big a problem
is the loss of biodiversity for the stability of ecological systems? How can
conservation biologists communicate the insurance benefit of biodiversity to
the public and policy makers? And, how can we apply limited conservation funds
to manage biodiversity and limit risk in the face of increasing environmental
uncertainty?

Nearly a decade ago, @figge2004 and @koellner2006 laid the foundation
for why financial portfolio theory is ideally suited for answering these
questions. Financial portfolio theory seems applicable to ecological systems
for at least four reasons. (1) Ecological and financial systems are both
structured hierarchically. Groups of populations form metapopulations and
groups of species form communities; groups of financial assets form investment
funds, which in turn form portfolios. (2) Ecological and financial managers
have similar goals. Ecological resource managers maximize productivity and
minimize the probability of ecological collapse; financial portfolio managers
maximize expected financial returns and minimize the probability of large
economic losses [@may2008]. (3) Substantial resources have gone into developing
mathematical theory for optimizing financial investments. There is therefore
a rich body of theory and experience to draw from. (4) The portfolio metaphor
is an engaging and accessible way for ecologists and conservationists to think
about ecological variance and biological diversity and convey the importance of
this (often abstract) literature.

A flurry of recent studies has used financial portfolios as a metaphor,
metric, or management approach to estimate and communicate the insurance
benefit of diversity and prioritize its conservation [e.g. @schindler2010;
@ando2011; @halpern2011; @hoekstra2012; @anderson2013]. For example, @moore2010
used the portfolio metaphor to show how increased synchrony of salmon
populations could lead to heightened extinction risk. @thibaut2012 used the
portfolio-effect metric to quantify the insurance benefit of diversity for reef
fish communities. @ando2012 used portfolio optimization to prioritize habitat
for conservation that would create wetlands most robust to climate-change
uncertainty. Portfolio theory promises to move ecology beyond the familiar
concepts of the quantity, variety, and distribution of species [@mace2005]
and into a new dimension that emphasizes elements of variance, covariance,
stability, and synchrony [@loreau2010a].

But in applying financial theory to ecology, where does the portfolio metaphor
break down? What exactly are the assets, portfolios, and investors in the
financial metaphor? Further, in a changing world how might one invest in
different kinds of ecological portfolios? Is the metaphor precise enough to
generate ecological portfolio indices and use portfolio theory to actively
manage or conserve ecological systems? And how might the differences between
financial and ecological data affect our ability to apply financial portfolio
theory to ecology? Are ecological portfolios just another name for existing
ecological theory? Or, can ecological portfolios act as a unifying lens through
which we view a wide variety of ecological theory?

Here, we address these questions by reviewing the rapidly emerging literature
on ecological portfolios. The purpose of our review is fourfold: (1) Review the
three recent contrasting applications of ecological portfolios as metaphors,
metrics, and management tools. (2) Illustrate how ecological portfolios can
act as a unifying lens though which we can view a wide variety of modern
ecological theory. (3) Highlight the imprecision of the metaphor given how we
invest in financial and ecological portfolios and how data from the two fields
differ. (4) Emphasize the utility of portfolio optimization for conservation
prioritization.

# Ecological portfolios as a metaphor

Metaphors can powerfully shape how we perceive scientific ideas [@larson2011].
In ecology, the portfolio concept has long been used as a metaphor to emphasize
the need to "not put all your eggs in one basket", although the metaphor has
come into particular prominence in the last 5--10 years. For example, the IUCN
Criterion B2a recognizes the risks associated with a species existing in
a single location [@iucn2001]. As another example, ecologists have suggested
the need for a portfolio of possible solutions or approaches as a bet hedging
strategy [e.g. @ehrlich2008]. Ecologists have also used the metaphor to loosely
refer to diverse ecosystems as portfolios of species [REFs]. These applications
are an appealing way to convey concepts of diversification, uncertainty, and
risk using familiar terminology. On the surface the metaphor seems intuitive;
however, recent studies have pressed the metaphor further as both a metric and
management tool [@moore2010; @schindler2010; @halpern2011; @ando2012] and the
question remains how far we can take the metaphor before it breaks down
[@anderson2013].

# The portfolio-effect metric

Beyond the metaphor, the portfolio-effect metric asks what the precise benefit
is of a unit increase in biodiversity. The portfolio effect is derived from
the economic question: How much better off are you by investing your money in
a diversified portfolio instead of investing all your money in a single asset
[@markowitz1952]? In ecology, we consider the current ecological system the
diversified portfolio and a theoretical homogeneous (or monoculture) system the
single asset [@anderson2013]. For example, we could ask how much more stable
is a metapopulation of salmon from different streams, rivers, or watersheds
(the portfolio) compared to a theoretical homogeneous stream population
(the single asset) [@schindler2010; @carlson2011]. Hence, to accurately
measure a portfolio effect we need to predict the variability of a theoretical
homogeneous system --- a system that lacks the element of biodiversity we are
interested in. Unfortunately, although the portfolio metaphor provides a new
lens through which to view the diversity-stability relationship, on its own
it remains unclear whether it provides new insights about the nature of the
relationship itself.

Nonetheless, by providing a new lens, the portfolio effect as a metric
has created an impetus for new theoretical and empirical insights into
stability-diversity relationships. Early work focused on theoretical aspects of
the portfolio effect for greatly simplified systems --- identifying when we
would expect a stabilizing portfolio effect and what factors would enhance it
[@doak1998; @tilman1998; @lehman2000]. Over time theoretical studies developed
indices that relaxed assumptions about the systems they describe [@loreau2010a;
@thibaut2013]. Furthermore, integrating numerous theories from the last
decade, @thibaut2013 reduced the portfolio effect to a weighted-average effect
of variability and a synchrony effect. A recent trend has been to apply
these indices to empirical data, albeit primarily to salmon [@greene2010;
@schindler2010; @carlson2011; @anderson2013; @mellin2014]. However, empirical
work has primarily concentrated on applying relatively simple portfolio-effect
metrics that make strong assumptions that are rarely met in empirical systems
[@thibaut2013; @anderson2013]. Violation of these assumptions can strongly
distort our perception of the portfolio effect and hence the perceived benefit
of diversity to ecological stability [@anderson2013].

# Ecological portfolio management

In addition to measuring the portfolio effect metric, we can use financial
portfolio theory to direct ecological resource management. Markowitz's seminal
contribution to financial portfolio theory was a focus on portfolio selection
--- the idea that out of all possible portfolios there exists a subset that
optimize a risk-return trade-off [@markowitz1952]. In ecology, the goals of
ecological resource management often parallel those of financial managers,
even though they are rarely expressed as such [@figge2004]. We see ecological
portfolio management happening in one of three ways: (1) considering and
promoting existing management structures that promote diversified portfolios,
(2) using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize ecological resource
extraction, or (3) using MPT to optimize an ecological system itself.

First, we can consider existing management structures that create systems
analogous to diversified portfolios. For example, fishers can engage in
catch-pooling cooperatives where fishers share the profits from their catches
according to predefined rules. @sethi2012 showed that this portfolio-like
scheme reduces risk for red king crab fishers in the Bering Sea by up to 40%.
Other fisheries management tools, such as community-based management, individual
transferable quotas (ITQs), and licensing systems that allow for fishing a
diversity of species, can create diversified catch portfolios for fishers
and buffer fishers against the risk of poor profits [@hilborn2001; @kasperski2013].
Alternatively, we can consider the properties of a diversified portfolio,
such as representation, resilience, and redundancy, and look for management
strategies that promote these properties in ecological systems [@haak2012]

Second, we can use MPT directly to optimally allocate harvesting efforts. This
suggestion is not new --- some of the earliest references to ecological
portfolios suggest portfolio theory as a management tool [@baldursson1997;
@costanza2000] but few studies have explored the idea to its full extent
and interest in the topic has expanded strongly in recent years [e.g.
@edwards2004; @sanchirico2008; @halpern2011; @moloney2011]. In ecology,
portfolio optimization can be applied spatially. For example, @halpern2011
used MPT to maximize fishing profits while minimizing spatial unevenness. MPT
has also been used to optimize decisions about whether to clearcut or retain
standing trees [@hyytiainen2008; @hildebrandt2011]. As a third example,
@moloney2011 used MPT to optimize the choice of grazing animals on Australia's
rangelands.  With few exceptions, however, the application of MPT for
harvesting decisions has been limited to fishery and forestry examples.

Third, we can use ecological portfolio management to choose how we allocate
conservation efforts to manage risk for an ecological system as a whole. For
example, portfolio optimization can be used to spatially allocate conservation
activity for wetlands to maximize ecosystem services while minimizing
uncertainty due to climate change [@ando2011; @ando2012]. In forestry, MPT has
been used to select the optimal weighting of seed sources for regenerating
forests under a variety of climate change scenarios [@crowe2008]. We see this as
a promising but largely unexplored use of the ecological portfolio concept, and
we revisit this topic in the *Opportunities* section of this paper.

# Ecological theory to draw from

Portfolio theory represents both a new lens through which to view existing
ecological theories and the glue that can hold together many ecological
theories (Table \ref{tab:theory}). For example, the theory of island
biogeography, metapopulation dynamics, and functional-group ecology can all
generate portfolio-like ecological structure. Furthermore, a variety of
mechanisms can generate ecological portfolio diversification: intraspecific
trait variation [@bolnick2011], response diversity [@elmqvist2003;
@loreau2013], personality variation [@wolf2012], biocomplexity
[@hutchinson2008], diversity of competitive interactions [@mougi2012], and
complementarity of function [@gonzalez2009]. Generally, there's a need to draw
from across these disciplines, which often stay within their own niche, often
use different terminology for the same concept (e.g. TODO). A strength of
ecological portfolio theory is that it encourages us to consider all these
elements in conjunction.

TODO more examples here. Pull out elements from table.

<!--For example, the Moran effect identifies that ecological assets that are closer together may provide less diversification for a portfolio since they will experience more similar environments.-->


# Challenges of applying the metaphor

## Precision of the metaphor

The definition of an asset in ecological portfolios has been broad. Recent
work has, for example, considered protected areas [@ando2012], salmon
abundance [@greene2010; @moore2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011], and
shark habitat [@yates2012] as assets in ecological portfolios. But we have
only begun to see the types of ecological assets that can be considered. We
suggest the question shouldn't be whether some ecological unit matches a
specific definition of an asset but rather if considering that unit in an
asset-portfolio context is useful. Importantly, how we invest in an ecological
asset affects its interpretation in a portfolio context. Below we outline two
investment styles that we refer to as partial- and whole-asset investment (Fig.
\ref{fig:salmonport}).

Partial-asset investment are akin to the traditional concept of a financial
portfolio (Fig. \ref{fig:salmonport}a). In finance, an investor has a fixed
quantity of money to invest and the investor uses that money to buy portions
of financial assets. The majority of financial portfolio theory has been
developed around this investment model. An ecological example would be a
fisher allocating harvesting resources into fishing a suite of species
[@baldursson1997; @edwards2004; @kasperski2013]. Alternatively, a grizzly bear
might consume fish from a number of streams (Fig. \ref{fig:salmonport}a). In
both the financial and ecological context, partial-asset investment allows the
investor to alter his or her investment with relative ease. Both the fisher
and grizzly bear can often choose to allocate their efforts across different
species or different streams.

Whole-asset investment are less common in finance but abundant in ecology
(Fig. \ref{fig:salmonport}b). In a whole-asset investment, the investor
chooses to invest his or her resources in the entirety of an asset. For
example, a financial investor might purchase a suite of small businesses. In
ecology, a manager might manage a suite (catchment) of salmon populations
[@schindler2010]. At the same time, a conservation agency might campaign
for a certain allocation of conservation efforts toward that catchment.
(Fig. \ref{fig:salmonport}b). In these whole-asset examples, if the investor
wishes to redistribute investment, the investor must change the size of the
assets themselves (e.g. by changing the habitat available for each salmon
population). Furthermore, different investors invested in the same ecological
assets may have disparate goals but the assets must be the same size in each
investor's portfolio. For example, the fisheries management and conservation
agencies might disagree on salmon return targets for a portfolio of salmon
stocks, but ultimately must come to a consensus if their portfolios share
stocks.

Why distinguish partial- and whole-asset investments in ecological portfolios?
The investment style affects: (1) How easy it is for an investor to increase
investment in one asset and decrease investment in another. (2) The
implications of the investor choosing to stop investing in an asset. (3) How
changing investment in an asset affects the risk and return properties of the
portfolio. (4) How conflicting interests of investors propagate through the
ecological portfolio. All these issues point to the challenges of applying
financial portfolio theory, which is mostly concerned with partial-asset
investment, to ecological portfolios, which are frequently whole-asset
investment portfolios.

## Attributes of financial and ecological data

Ecological and financial data differ in many fundamental ways that will affect
how financial portfolio theory can be applied to ecological systems (Table
\ref{tab:data}). For example, ecological data is often of short duration,
recorded at low frequency (e.g. each year), and often contains missing
values. Financial data, on the other hand, can be recorded every minute for
decades and rarely contains missing values. Financial statistics that depend
on such data may not be applicable to ecological data. For example, TODO. As
another example, ecological data often includes considerable measurement
error that adds uncertainty to inferences about the "value" of ecological
assets. Financial stock returns, however, reflect the trading value of a stock
by definition. Therefore, to accurately apply financial portfolio optimization
to ecological portfolios, we may need to adopt methods that incorporate
measurement error. Solutions may include Bayesian modelling, Monte Carlo
simulation, and state space models [@morgan1990].

# Opportunities

## Ecological portfolio optimization

A central focus of financial portfolio theory is selecting an optimal weighting
of assets to maximize return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for
a given level of return [@markowitz1952]. In this paper, we have discussed
optimizing ecological resource use to improve the income of ecological
resource harvesters. However, we have mentioned only two examples of portfolio
optimization that benefit a purely conservation outcome [@crowe2008; @ando2012].
We suggest taking the ecological portfolio management concept to its logical
extension: consider optimizing portfolios of ecological assets with the
goal of maximizing ecological productivity while minimizing the risk of low
productivity.

Any ecological scenario that produces time series analogous to typical
financial stock time series may be a candidate for ecological conservation
portfolio optimization. Population growth rate within a metapopulation context
is one possibility and will generally represent a stationary time series in the
same way that the first difference of returns are frequently used in financial
portfolio analysis [REF]. The central issue with applying conservation-oriented
ecological portfolio optimization will be deciding what precisely constitutes
"investment" and how that investment re-allocation will occur. For example,
if the abundance of fish stocks is considered investment how does one
increase or decrease that investment through time? Perhaps these adjustments
could be made through changes in harvesting limits, stock supplementation, or
habitat restoration. Realistic re-investment strategies may be taxa, region, or
case-specific, but are thus far mostly unexplored.

## Ecological risk metrics

Ecology has typically used metrics of symmetric variability such as the
standard deviation or the coefficient of variation of a time series [e.g.
@greene2010] and sometimes loosely referred to the result as risk; but, risk
specifically refers both to the probability of something "undesired" happening
and the magnitude of that event [@rachev2008] (Fig. \ref{fig:risk}). For
example, if an outcome is unknown but can only end positively, it presents
little risk. Therefore, ecological risk metrics should allow for an asymmetry in
this "desirableness" or loss function [@reckhow1994]. Furthermore, recent work
in ecology has noted the frequency and influence of "ecological surprises"
[@lindenmayer2010; @doak2012] and counterintuitive responses of populations to
management [@pine-iii2009]. Therefore, like financial risk metrics, ecological
risk metrics should allow for fat-tailed probability distributions. The
financial literature is rich with methods to rapidly assess the risk properties
of time series --- methods that are particularly useful when used as part of
portfolio optimization [@rachev2008].

Recent financial literature has focused on downside risk metrics [@ang2006],
which emphasize the probability of an "undesired" event; we see great
opportunity for their application in ecology (Fig. \ref{fig:risk}). A variety
of downside risk metrics measure different properties of risk. Therefore,
how do different metrics reflect the goals of different "investors" in
ecological portfolios? Conservation organizations, for example, may be
concerned with avoiding catastrophic single years that could influence
future productivity or have down-stream effects on predators or prey. They
might use the probability of ruin, which measures the probability of an
event worse than some threshold occurring [@vasicek1987] or the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) to characterize the average magnitude of an extremely
bad event [@rockafellar2002; @sethi2012a; @sethi2012b]. Resource users, on
the other hand, might wish to minimize year-to-year fluctuations to ensure
a stable income. Their interests could be reflected in the semideviation
or semivariance, which characterizes a typical bad event [@markowitz1959;
@sethi2012a; @sethi2012b]. Moving forward, a fruitful area of research may be
matching risk metrics to specific resource-management goals [@sethi2012a].

# Outlook

Ecological portfolio theory is still a young discipline and there exist many
important future questions to address: For example:

- Across taxa, geography, and time, how pervasive is the stabilizing ecological
portfolio effect and what factors affect its strength? Recent work suggests the
effect may vary greatly across systems, but the general pervasiveness and the
factors that promote it remain largely unclear [@anderson2013].

- How can the portfolio effect and portfolio optimization inform management
and conservation and in what other contexts can it be applied? For example,
how might the portfolio effect and optimization inform the debate about single
large or several small reserves (SLOSS) debate? As another example, what can
financial portfolio theory tell us about managing the recovery of ecological
systems?

- How can we integrate established principles of ecological resource management
with portfolio theory? Furthermore, what elements of portfolio theory can we
integrate with traditional principles of ecological management?

- How can we move ecological portfolio theory beyond an academic exercise
to using its principles in applied management? Recent work has shown clear
theoretical advantages to ecological conservation that considers MPT
[@crowe2008; @ando2012; @anderson2014], but MPT has yet to be integrated into
real-word conservation planning.

In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of thinking about ecological
portfolios from all dimensions --- as metaphors, metrics, and management
tools. Management, in particular, represents an exciting area of research that
ecology has just begun exploring. Ecological portfolios can apply to a wide
variety of ecological assets, ecological investors, and investment styles, but
we need to carefully consider both imprecision in the metaphor [@anderson2013]
and how fundamental differences between financial and ecological data may
restrict the financial portfolio methods we can apply in ecology or require
modifying existing methods. Ecological portfolio theory's greatest strength may
be that it unites a wide variety of ecological theories along with concepts
of risk, uncertainty, and variability. However, we need to be careful not to
re-invent existing theory and instead use the ecological portfolio concept as
the glue that unites ecological disciplines in a way that's useful to research
and management, and that conveys the salient concepts clearly to the public and
resource managers.
