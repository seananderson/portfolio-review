# Introduction

In the coming century we face a loss of biodiversity on the order of 100--10,000 times greater than average rates in the fossil record [@mea2005] --- a rate as fast if not faster than any of the five past mass extinctions [@barnosky2011].
Compounding this problem for ecological resource managers is uncertainty in future climate conditions [@heller2009] and the unknown responses of species and communities to those conditions [@lavergne2010].
Therefore, urgent questions are: Exactly how big a problem is the loss of biodiversity for the stability of ecological systems?
How can conservation biologists communicate the insurance benefit of biodiversity to the public and policy makers?
And, how can we apply limited conservation funds to manage biodiversity and limit risk in the face of increasing environmental uncertainty?

Nearly a decade ago, @figge2004 and @koellner2006 laid the foundation for why financial portfolio theory is ideally suited for answering these questions.
Financial portfolio theory seems applicable to ecological systems for at least four reasons.
(1) Ecological and financial systems are both structured hierarchically.
Groups of populations form metapopulations and groups of species form communities; groups of financial assets form investment funds, which in turn form portfolios.
(2) Ecological and financial managers have similar goals.
Ecological resource managers maximize productivity and minimize the probability of ecological collapse; financial portfolio managers maximize expected financial returns and minimize the probability of large economic losses [@may2008].
(3) Substantial resources have gone into developing mathematical theory for optimizing financial investments.
There is therefore a rich body of theory and experience to draw from.
(4) The portfolio metaphor is an engaging and accessible way for ecologists and conservationists to think about ecological variance and biological diversity and convey the importance of this (often abstract) literature.

A flurry of recent studies has used financial portfolios as a metaphor, metric, or management approach to estimate and communicate the insurance benefit of diversity and prioritize its conservation [@schindler2010; @ando2011; @halpern2011; @hoekstra2012; @anderson2013].
For example, @moore2010 used the portfolio metaphor to show how increased synchrony of salmon populations could lead to heightened extinction risk.
@thibaut2012 used the portfolio-effect metric to quantify the insurance benefit of diversity for reef fish communities.
@ando2012 used portfolio optimization to prioritize habitat for conservation that would create wetlands most robust to climate-change uncertainty.
Portfolio theory promises to move ecology beyond the familiar concepts of the quantity, variety, and distribution of species [@mace2005] and into a new dimension that emphasizes elements of variance, covariance, stability, and synchrony [@loreau2010a].

But in applying financial theory to ecology, where does the portfolio metaphor break down?
What exactly are the assets, portfolios, and investors in the financial metaphor?
Further, in a changing world how might one invest in different kinds of ecological portfolios?
Is the metaphor precise enough to generate ecological portfolio indices and use portfolio theory to actively manage or conserve ecological systems?
And how might the differences between financial and ecological data affect our ability to apply financial portfolio theory to ecology?
Are ecological portfolios just another name for existing ecological theory?
Or, can ecological portfolios act as a unifying lens through which we view a wide variety of ecological theory?

Here, we address these questions by reviewing the rapidly emerging literature on ecological portfolios.
The purpose of our review is fourfold:
(1) Review the three recent contrasting applications of ecological portfolios as metaphors, metrics, and management tools.
(2) Illustrate how ecological portfolios can act as a unifying lens though which we can view a wide variety of modern ecological theory.
(3) Highlight the imprecision of the metaphor given how we invest in financial and ecological portfolios and how data from the two fields differ.
(4) Emphasize the utility of portfolio optimization for conservation prioritization.

# Ecological portfolios as a metaphor

- Metaphors can powerfully shape how we perceive scientific ideas [@larson2011].
- Ecology has long recognized the benefit of "not putting all your eggs in one basket".
- For example, the IUCN Criterion B2a recognizes the risks associated with a species existing in a single location [@iucn2001].
- The metaphor is pervasive on its own but also forms the basis for the portfolio-effect metric and portfolio management.

# The portfolio-effect metric

- Many recent studies have applied the metaphor quantitatively to ask exactly how much of a stabilizing benefit ecological systems get because they exist as a diversified portfolio [@greene2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011; @thibaut2012; @kasperski2013; @thibaut2013; @anderson2013].
- See Box 1: What is an ecological metric and what makes for a useful ecological metric?

# Ecological portfolio management

- The extension to measuring the portfolio-effect metric is to manage ecological systems using modern portfolio theory mean-variance optimization [@crowe2008; @hyytiainen2008; @sanchirico2008; @ando2011; @halpern2011; @moloney2011; @ando2012].
- See Figure 1: An introduction to Modern Portfolio Theory mean-variance optimization.

# Ecological theory to draw from

- Portfolio theory is both a new lens though which to view many other ecological theories and the glue that can hold together many ecological theories.
- For example, the theory of island biogeography, metapopulation dynamics, and functional-group ecology can all generate portfolio-like ecological structure.
- Further, a variety of mechanisms could generate ecological portfolio diversification: intraspecific trait variation [@bolnick2011], response diversity [@elmqvist2003; @loreau2013], personality variation [@wolf2012], biocomplexity [@hutchinson2008], diversity of competitive interactions [@mougi2012], complementarity of function [@gonzalez2009].
- see Table 1: Selected ecological theories and their relevance to ecological portfolios.

# Challenges of applying the metaphor

## Precision of the metaphor

- With financial portfolios we can easily adjust our investment in assets by buying and selling and most portfolio theory is developed around this model.
- However the way we invest in many ecological portfolios is different --- we invest in the entirety of each asset (say an entire stream of salmon) and it can be difficult to change our investment (say increase our investment in that stream of salmon through habitat restoration).
- We will explore the literature on different kinds of assets, investors, investment styles, and types of diversification for ecological portfolios and their implications for applying portfolio theory.
- For example, papers have considered investment as shark habitat [@yates2012], salmon abundance [@greene2010; @moore2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011], and protected-area size [@ando2012].

## A case study to illustrate the complexity

- Focus on how there are multiple investors for the same ecological assets with often-conflicting goals and different ways of managing their investment.
- see Figure \ref{fig:salmonport}: Components of ecological portfolios (included at end of document).

## Attributes of financial and ecological data

- Ecological and financial data differ in many fundamental ways that will affect how financial portfolio theory can be applied to ecological systems (e.g. duration, frequency, missing values, measurement error).
- see Table \ref{tab:data}: Attributes of financial and ecological data and their implications for ecological portfolios.

# Opportunities

**Conservation through ecological portfolio optimization**:
The majority of studies that have applied portfolio optimization to ecology have optimized financial outcomes [e.g. @hyytiainen2008; @sanchirico2008; @moloney2011].
This application is relatively straightforward.
Recent studies have started applying portfolio optimization to optimize purely conservation related goals [@crowe2008; @ando2012].
We consider how this represents a promising opportunity, while noting the challenges discussed earlier in our review.

**Ecological risk metrics**:
Risk refers both to the probability of something "undesired" happening and the magnitude of that event [@rachev2008].
Metrics such as the coefficient of variation can not capture the combination of these properties, but financial downside risk metrics can.
Exemplifying the need for proper risk metrics in ecology, recent papers have focused on the frequency of ecological surprises [@lindenmayer2010; @doak2012].
The financial literature increasingly relies on downside risk metrics [@ang2006] and the fisheries literature has begun applying these metrics to resource management [@sethi2012; @sethi2012a].
There is tremendous opportunity to match risk metrics to resource-management goals.

# Outlook

We will consider how the field can be moved forward and highlight pressing questions and opportunities.
