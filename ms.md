# Abstract

Portfolio terminology has been increasingly used in conservation biology since
the late 1990s; however, there lacks a unified consideration of its strengths
and weaknesses across its many applications. Here, we review three contrasting
applications of ecological portfolio theory. We show how ecological portfolios
have been used as metaphors to communicate the benefit of biological diversity,
as metrics to compare the benefits of diversification across systems and
through time, and as management tools to make robust conservation decisions in
the face of environmental uncertainty. We illustrate how ecological portfolios
can unite a wide variety of existing ecological theories---theories that
explain portfolio structure, causes of diversification and portfolio dynamics,
and the risk-reduction consequences of biological diversity. However, there are
potential issues with applying portfolio theory to conservation biology. For
example, there are substantial differences between biological and financial
data in terms of frequency, duration, interdependence, synchrony, and
measurement error. Furthermore, portfolio optimization works with
single-dimension objectives like financial stock value, but ecological
objectives are often multidimensional. Finally, we consider opportunities with
ecological portfolios. We emphasize the largely unexplored potential to apply
portfolio optimization to conservation planning and decision making. We then
introduce how downside financial risk metrics could benefit conservation
biology by measuring specific properties of risk, and illustrate these metrics
by applying them to sockeye salmon stocks (*Oncorhynchus nerka*) in the Fraser
River, British Columbia, Canada. We conclude by outlining key questions for
ecological portfolio theory to address in the coming years.

# Introduction

In the coming century we face a loss of biodiversity on the order of
100--10,000 times greater than average rates in the fossil record [@mea2005]
--- a rate as fast if not faster than any of the five past mass extinctions
[@barnosky2011; @harnik2012]. Compounding this problem for conservation
managers is uncertainty in future climate conditions [@heller2009] and the
unknown responses of species and communities to those conditions
[@lavergne2010]. Therefore, urgent questions are: Exactly how big a problem is
the loss of biodiversity for the stability of ecological systems? How can
conservation biologists communicate the insurance benefit of biodiversity to
the public and policy makers? And, how can we apply limited conservation funds
to manage biodiversity and limit risk in the face of increasing environmental
uncertainty?

Nearly a decade ago, @figge2004 and @koellner2006 laid the foundation for why
financial portfolio theory is ideally suited for answering these questions.
Financial portfolio theory seems applicable to ecological systems for at least
four reasons. First, ecological and financial systems are both structured
hierarchically. Groups of populations form metapopulations and groups of
species form communities; groups of financial assets form investment funds,
which in turn form portfolios. Additionally, ecological and financial managers
have similar goals. Conservation practitioners might wish to maximize
productivity and minimize the probability of ecological collapse; financial
portfolio managers maximize expected financial returns and minimize the
probability of large economic losses [@may2008]. Another reason why portfolio
theory is ideally suited for ecology is that substantial resources have gone
into developing mathematical theory for optimizing financial investments. There
is therefore a rich body of theory and experience to draw from. Finally, the
portfolio metaphor is an engaging and accessible way for ecologists and
conservationists to think about ecological variance and biological diversity
and convey the importance of this (often abstract) literature.

A number of recent studies have used financial portfolios as a metaphor,
metric, or management approach (Fig.Â \ref{fig:traits}) to estimate and
communicate the stabilizing benefit of diversity and prioritize its
conservation [e.g. @schindler2010; @ando2011; @halpern2011; @hoekstra2012;
@anderson2013; @mellin2014]. For example, @moore2010 used the portfolio
metaphor to show how increased synchrony of salmon populations could lead to
heightened extinction risk. @thibaut2012 used the portfolio-effect metric to
quantify the insurance benefit of diversity for reef fish communities.
@ando2012 used portfolio optimization to prioritize habitat for conservation
that would create wetlands most robust to climate-change uncertainty. Portfolio
theory promises to move conservation biology beyond the familiar concepts of
the quantity, variety, and distribution of species [@mace2005] and into a new
dimension that emphasizes elements of variance, covariance, stability,
synchrony, and extremeness [@loreau2010a; @thompson2013].

But in applying financial theory to conservation biology, where does the
portfolio metaphor break down? What exactly are the assets, portfolios, and
investors in the financial metaphor? Furthermore, how might one invest in
different kinds of ecological portfolios? And how might the differences between
financial and ecological data affect our ability to apply financial portfolio
theory to conservation biology? Are ecological portfolios just another name for
existing ecological theory? Or, can ecological portfolios bring together and
provide new insights into a wide variety of ecological theory?

Here, we address these questions by reviewing the emerging literature on
ecological portfolios. The purpose of our review is fourfold: review the three
recent contrasting applications of ecological portfolios as metaphors, metrics,
and management tools; illustrate how ecological portfolios can bring together a
wide variety of modern ecological theory; highlight some challenges of applying
financial theory to ecological portfolios; and emphasize the utility of
portfolio optimization and risk metrics for conservation prioritization.

# Ecological portfolios as a metaphor

Metaphors are powerful tools for communicating and shaping scientific ideas
[@brown2003] and are particularly useful in developing and communicating the
field of conservation biology [@larson2011]. In conservation biology, the
portfolio concept has long been used as a metaphor to emphasize the need to not
put all your eggs in one basket. This metaphor has come into particular
prominence in the last decade. For example, the IUCN Criterion B2a recognizes
the risks associated with a species existing in few locations [@iucn2001]. As
another example, ecologists have suggested the need to bet hedge by developping
a portfolio of approaches when tackling conservation issues [e.g.
@ehrlich2008]. Ecologists have also used the metaphor to refer to diverse
ecosystems and communities as portfolios of species [@figge2004]. These
applications are an appealing way to convey concepts of diversification,
uncertainty, and risk using familiar terminology. 
<!--On the surface the metaphor seems intuitive; however, recent studies have-->
<!--pressed the metaphor further as both a metric and management tool [e.g.-->
<!--@moore2010; @schindler2010; @halpern2011; @ando2012; @anderson2014] and the-->
<!--question remains how far we can take the metaphor before it breaks down-->
<!--[@anderson2013].-->

# The portfolio-effect metric

Beyond the metaphor, the portfolio-effect metric asks what the precise benefit
is of a unit increase in diversity. The portfolio effect is derived from the
economic question: How much better off are you by investing your money in a
diversified portfolio instead of investing all your money in a single asset
[@markowitz1952]? In conservation biology, we can consider the current
ecological system the diversified portfolio and a theoretical homogeneous (or
monoculture) system the single asset [@anderson2013]. For example, we could ask
how much more stable is a metapopulation of salmon from different streams,
rivers, or watersheds (the portfolio) compared to a theoretical homogeneous
stream population (the single asset) [@schindler2010; @carlson2011]. Hence, to
accurately measure a portfolio effect we need to predict the variability of a
theoretical homogeneous system---a system that lacks the element of
biodiversity we are interested in. Unfortunately, although the portfolio
metaphor provides a new way of looking at the decades-old diversity-stability
debate, on its own it remains unclear whether it provides new insights about
the nature of the relationship itself.

Nonetheless, by providing a new lens, the portfolio effect as a metric has
created an impetus for new theoretical and empirical insights into
stability-diversity relationships. Early work focused on theoretical aspects of
the portfolio effect for greatly simplified systems---identifying when we
would expect a stabilizing portfolio effect and what factors would enhance it
[@doak1998; @tilman1998; @lehman2000]. Over time, theoretical studies developed
indices that relaxed assumptions about the systems they describe [e.g.
@loreau2010a; @thibaut2013; @gross2013]. A recent trend has been to apply these
indices to empirical data, albeit primarily to salmon [@greene2010;
@schindler2010; @carlson2011; @anderson2013; @mellin2014]. However, empirical
work has concentrated on applying relatively simple portfolio-effect metrics
that make strong assumptions that are rarely met in empirical systems
[@thibaut2013; @anderson2013]. Violation of these assumptions, for example, the
assumption that the temporal standard deviation scales directly with the mean,
or that populations are approximately equal in size, can distort our perception
of the portfolio effect and hence the perceived benefit of diversity to
ecological stability [@anderson2013].

<!--TODO Bring in the @gross2013 paper and metric and give more details on
    @thibaut2013 - give examples-->

# Ecological portfolio management

In addition to measuring the portfolio-effect metric, we can use financial
portfolio theory to inform decisions about conservation management. Markowitz's
seminal contribution to financial portfolio theory was a focus on portfolio
selection---the idea that out of all possible portfolios there exists a
subset that optimize a risk-return trade-off [@markowitz1952]
(Fig.Â \ref{fig:mpt}). In conservation biology, the goals of conservation
practitioners often parallel those of financial managers, even though they are
rarely expressed as such [@figge2004]. We see ecological portfolio management
happening in one of three ways: choosing existing management structures that
promote diversified portfolios, using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize
ecological resource extraction, or using MPT to optimize an ecological system
itself.

First, we can consider existing management structures that create systems
analogous to diversified portfolios. For example, fishers can engage in
catch-pooling cooperatives where fishers share the profits from their catches
according to predefined rules. @sethi2012 showed that this portfolio-like
scheme reduces risk for red king crab fishers in the Bering Sea by up to 40%.
Other fisheries management tools, such as community-based management,
individual transferable quotas (ITQs), and licensing systems that allow for
fishing a diversity of species, can create diversified catch portfolios for
fishers and buffer fishers against the risk of poor profits [@hilborn2001;
@kasperski2013]. Alternatively, we can consider the properties of a diversified
portfolio, such as representation, resilience, and redundancy, and look for
management strategies that promote these properties in ecological systems
[@haak2012]

We can also use MPT directly to optimally allocate harvesting efforts. This
suggestion is not new---some of the earliest references to ecological
portfolios suggest portfolio theory as a management tool [@baldursson1997;
@costanza2000] but few studies have explored the idea to its full extent and
interest in the topic has expanded strongly in recent years [e.g. @edwards2004;
@sanchirico2008; @halpern2011; @moloney2011]. In conservation biology,
portfolio optimization can be applied spatially. For example, @halpern2011 used
MPT to illustrate the tradeoff between fishing profits and spatial unevenness
of marine resource value. MPT has also been used to optimize decisions about
whether to clearcut or retain standing trees [@hyytiainen2008;
@hildebrandt2011]. As a third example, @moloney2011 used MPT to optimize the
choice of grazing animals on Australia's rangelands. With few exceptions,
however, the application of MPT for harvesting decisions has been limited to
fishery and forestry examples.

Finally, we can use ecological portfolio management to choose how we allocate
conservation efforts to manage risk for an ecological system as a whole. For
example, portfolio optimization can be used to spatially allocate conservation
activity for wetlands to maximize ecosystem services while minimizing
uncertainty due to climate change [@ando2011; @ando2012]. In forestry, MPT has
been used to select the optimal weighting of seed sources for regenerating
forests under a variety of climate change scenarios [@crowe2008]. In fisheries,
MPT has been used to assess the risk-return trade-off for salmon metapopulation
productivity given choices about what habitat to conserve under climate change
and stream-flow reduction scenarios [@anderson2014]. We see this as a promising
but largely unexplored use of ecological portfolio theory, and we revisit this
topic in the *Opportunities* section of this paper.

# Ecological theory to draw from

Portfolio theory can unite many existing ecological theories (Table
\ref{tab:theory}). For example, community ecology, the theory of island
biogeography, metapopulation dynamics, and functional-group ecology can all
generate portfolio-like ecological structure. Importantly, the portfolios
produced by these scenarios have specific features that affect portfolio
dynamics. For example, in community portfolios, predator assets can eat
portions of prey assets, which has no direct equivalent in financial
portfolios. In metapopulation portfolios, subpopulation assets can exchange
individuals between each other and rescue subpopulation assets at low abundance
or value.

Other ecological theories can inform expected patterns of diversification and
portfolio dynamics (Table \ref{tab:theory}). For instance, the Moran effect
suggests that ecological assets that are further apart from each other are more
likely to experience diverse environments and therefore provide greater
portfolio diversification. The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and
biogeography asks what we would observe if species were functionally
equivalent. We can think of this neutral community as an undiversified
portfolio and compare it to observed communities to examine the benefit of
functional diversity. This comparison is analogous to the portfolio-effect
metric in recent literature [e.g. @doak1998; @schindler2010; @anderson2013].

Finally, a variety of mechanisms can generate ecological portfolio
diversification (Table \ref{tab:theory}). For instance, intraspecific trait
variation, response diversity, and even personality variation can be thought of
as sources of portfolio diversification. Ecological portfolios therefore can
have multiple levels of diversification, just as financial portfolios can be
diversified across multiple levels such as investment types, geography,
business sectors, and individual stocks. Whereas research on many of these
ecological sources of diversification exists in its own niche, ecological
portfolio theory encourages us to consider many elements in conjunction.

<!--The definition of an asset in ecological portfolios has been broad. Recent
    work has, for example, considered protected areas [@ando2012], salmon
    abundance [@greene2010; @moore2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011;
    @yeakel2014], moth abundance [@anderson2013], reef fish abundance
    [@anderson2013; @mellin2014], and shark habitat [@yates2012] as assets in
    ecological portfolios. But we have only begun to see the types of
    ecological assets that can be considered. -->

<!--An ecological example would be a fisher allocating harvesting resources
    into fishing a suite of species [@baldursson1997; @edwards2004;
    @kasperski2013]. Alternatively, a grizzly bear might consume fish from a
    number of streams (Fig.Â \ref{fig:salmonport}a). -->

# Challenges

## Multidimensional ecological attributes

Ecological decision making is often a multidimensional problem. For example, a
manager needs to balance resources available for hunting or fishing with
leaving sufficient resources for ecosystem stability and function. But,
financial portfolio optimization typically deals with one dimension---financial
returns. Therefore, at first glance it might appear that portfolio optimization
is only applicable to a narrow range of ecological decision making. On the
contrary, existing approaches developed for other decision making tools can
allow portfolio theory to be applied to multidimensional objectives. For
instance, the roots of decision analysis (REF) [@keeney1976; @keeney1982], a
formal method for evaluating complex decision problems, deals with decision
making for one-dimensional objectives. But, decision analysis is commonly
extended to multiple objectives by condensing objectives into a single
dimension through multiattribute utility theory [@keeney1976] or presenting the
results of multiple decision trees and allowing decision makers to explicitly
see the trade off between multiple objectives (REF). A similar approach could
be applied to ecological portfolio optimization. Furthermore, there is no
reason why portfolio optimization cannot be combined with other decision making
approaches (REF).

## Attributes of financial and ecological data

Ecological and financial data differ in many fundamental ways that will affect
how financial portfolio theory can be applied to ecological systems (Table
\ref{tab:data}). For example, ecological data are often of short duration,
recorded at low frequency (e.g.Â each year), and often contain missing values.
Financial data, on the other hand, are often available at extremely high
frequency (e.g. by the second), are often available for decades, and rarely
contain missing values. Econometric techniques built to manage high-frequency
irregularly-spaced financial data [e.g. @hautsch2012] may not apply to much of
today's ecological data. However, these techniques may become increasingly
useful as similar types of ecological data become more common [e.g.Â the Ocean
Tracking Network, @cooke2011]. Another difference between financial and
ecological data, is that ecological data often include considerable measurement
error that adds uncertainty around the true value of ecological assets.
Financial stock returns, however, reflect the trading value of a stock by
definition. Therefore, to accurately apply financial portfolio optimization to
ecological portfolios, we may need to adopt methods that can incorporate
measurement error. Solutions may include Bayesian methods, Monte Carlo
simulation, and state space modelling [@morgan1990].

# Opportunities

## Ecological portfolio optimization

A central focus of financial portfolio theory is selecting an optimal weighting
of assets to maximize return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a
given level of return [@markowitz1952]. In this paper, we have discussed
optimizing ecological resource use to improve the income of ecological resource
harvesters. However, we have mentioned only three examples of portfolio
optimization that benefit a purely conservation outcome [@crowe2008; @ando2012;
@anderson2014]. 
<!--We suggest taking the ecological portfolio management concept to its
    logical extension: consider optimizing portfolios of ecological assets with
    the goal of maximizing ecological productivity while minimizing the risk of
    low productivity.-->

Any ecological scenario that produces time series analogous to typical
financial stock time series may be a candidate for ecological conservation
portfolio optimization. Population growth rate within a metapopulation context
is one possibility and will generally represent a stationary time series in the
same way that the first difference of returns are frequently used in financial
portfolio analysis [@anderson2014] (Fig.Â \ref{fig:risk}). The central issue
with applying conservation-oriented ecological portfolio optimization will be
deciding what precisely constitutes "investment" and how that investment
re-allocation will occur. For example, if abundance of fish stocks is
considered investment how does one increase or decrease that investment through
time? Perhaps these adjustments could be made through changes in harvesting
limits, stock supplementation, or habitat restoration. Realistic reinvestment
strategies may be taxa-, region-, or case-specific, and are so far mostly
unexplored.

## Ecological risk metrics

Risk assessment is a critical component to biological conservation and
management [@burgman2005]. Conservation biology has typically used metrics of
symmetric variability such as the standard deviation or the coefficient of
variation of a time series [e.g. @greene2010] and sometimes loosely referred to
the result as risk; but, risk specifically refers to both the probability of an
undesired event happening and the magnitude of loss associated with that event
[@morgan1990, Fig.Â \ref{fig:risk}]. For example, if a precise outcome is
unknown but can only end positively, it presents little risk. Therefore,
ecological risk metrics should allow for an asymmetry in this loss function
[@reckhow1994]. Furthermore, recent work in ecology has noted the frequency and
influence of population dynamic catastrophes [@gerber2001; @ward2007],
ecological surprises [@lindenmayer2010; @doak2008], counterintuitive responses
of populations to management [@pine-iii2009], and ecological black
swans---statistically improbable events with large influence that nonetheless
occur [@nunez2012]. Therefore, like financial risk metrics, we should consider
heavier-tailed probability distributions than standard distributions such as
the normal [@hummel2009]. The financial literature is rich with methods to
rapidly assess the risk properties of time series---methods that are
particularly useful when used as part of portfolio optimization [@rachev2008].

Recent financial literature has focused on downside risk metrics [@ang2006],
which emphasize the probability of an undesired event; we see great opportunity
for their application in conservation biology (Fig.Â \ref{fig:risk}). A variety
of downside risk metrics measure different properties of risk. Therefore, how
do different metrics reflect the goals of different "investors" in ecological
portfolios? Conservation organizations, for example, may be concerned with
avoiding catastrophic single years that could influence future productivity or
have downstream effects on predators or prey. They might use the probability of
ruin, which measures the probability of an event worse than some threshold
occurring [@vasicek1987] or the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to
characterize the average magnitude of an extremely bad event [@rockafellar2002;
@sethi2012a; @sethi2012b]. Resource users, on the other hand, might wish to
minimize year-to-year fluctuations to ensure a stable income. Their interests
could be reflected in the semideviation or semivariance, which characterizes
the typical "badness" or severity of an event [@markowitz1959; @sethi2012a;
@sethi2012b]. Moving forward, a fruitful area of research may be matching risk
metrics to specific conservation-management goals [@sethi2012a].

# Outlook

The application of portfolios concepts to ecological systems is still a young
discipline and there exist many important future questions to address: For
example:

1. Across taxa, geography, and time, how pervasive is the stabilizing
   ecological portfolio effect and what factors affect its strength? Recent
   work suggests the effect may vary greatly across systems, but the general
   pervasiveness and the factors that promote it remain largely unclear [e.g.
   @anderson2013; @mellin2014].

2. How can the portfolio effect and portfolio optimization inform management
   and conservation and in what other contexts can it be applied? For instance,
   how might portfolio optimization inform the debate about the advantages of
   forming single large or several small reserves (SLOSS)? As another example,
   what can portfolio optimization tell us about managing the recovery of
   impacted ecological systems?

3. How can we integrate established principles of conservation management with
   portfolio theory? Furthermore, what elements of portfolio theory can we
   integrate with traditional principles of ecological management?

4. How can we move ecological portfolios beyond an academic exercise to using
   their principles in applied management? Recent work has shown clear
   theoretical advantages to ecological conservation that considers MPT
   [@crowe2008; @ando2012; @anderson2014], but, to our knowledge, MPT has yet
   to be integrated into real-word conservation planning.

# Recommendations

Given our review of ecological portfolios, we make the following
recommendations:

1. Consider whether conservation problems can fit into a portfolio framework.
   Simultaneously considering how management actions affect mean responses and
   variability (or risk) of responses is a powerful conservation management
   tool and can be integrated with decision analysis.

2. Portfolio optimization can be applied right now in cases where 'investors',
   'assets', and 'reinvestment' concepts are clear and where there are a
   limited number of objectives to optimize. For example, we can use portfolio
   optimization to set habitat conservation priorities for salmon populations
   under climate change uncertainty [@anderson2014].

3. A rich area of research is exploring how we can apply portfolio optimization
   to ecological decision making for systems where data properties differ
   substantially from financial data. Another important area of applied
   research is determining how we can operationalize the outputs of ecological
   portfolio optimization into conservation decisions.

4. Even if not used as a research tool, portfolios provide a compelling
   metaphor to communicate the sometimes-abstract concept of biological
   diversity and its impact on risk, uncertainty, and variability to
   conservation managers and the public.
