# Introduction

In the coming century we face a loss of biodiversity on the order of
100--10,000 times greater than average rates in the fossil record [@mea2005]
--- a rate as fast if not faster than any of the five past mass extinctions
[@barnosky2011]. Compounding this problem for ecological resource managers
is uncertainty in future climate conditions [@heller2009] and the unknown
responses of species and communities to those conditions [@lavergne2010].
Therefore, urgent questions are: Exactly how big a problem is the loss of
biodiversity for the stability of ecological systems? How can conservation
biologists communicate the insurance benefit of biodiversity to the public
and policy makers? And, how can we apply limited conservation funds to
manage biodiversity and limit risk in the face of increasing environmental
uncertainty?

Nearly a decade ago, @figge2004 and @koellner2006 laid the foundation for why
financial portfolio theory is ideally suited for answering these questions.
Financial portfolio theory seems applicable to ecological systems for at
least four reasons. (1) Ecological and financial systems are both structured
hierarchically. Groups of populations form metapopulations and groups of
species form communities; groups of financial assets form investment funds,
which in turn form portfolios. (2) Ecological and financial managers have
similar goals. Ecological resource managers maximize productivity and minimize
the probability of ecological collapse; financial portfolio managers maximize
expected financial returns and minimize the probability of large economic
losses [@may2008]. (3) Substantial resources have gone into developing
mathematical theory for optimizing financial investments. There is therefore
a rich body of theory and experience to draw from. (4) The portfolio metaphor
is an engaging and accessible way for ecologists and conservationists to think
about ecological variance and biological diversity and convey the importance
of this (often abstract) literature.

A flurry of recent studies has used financial portfolios as a metaphor,
metric, or management approach to estimate and communicate the insurance
benefit of diversity and prioritize its conservation [@schindler2010;
@ando2011; @halpern2011; @hoekstra2012; @anderson2013]. For example,
@moore2010 used the portfolio metaphor to show how increased synchrony of
salmon populations could lead to heightened extinction risk. @thibaut2012
used the portfolio-effect metric to quantify the insurance benefit of
diversity for reef fish communities. @ando2012 used portfolio optimization to
prioritize habitat for conservation that would create wetlands most robust to
climate-change uncertainty. Portfolio theory promises to move ecology beyond
the familiar concepts of the quantity, variety, and distribution of species
[@mace2005] and into a new dimension that emphasizes elements of variance,
covariance, stability, and synchrony [@loreau2010a].

But in applying financial theory to ecology, where does the portfolio metaphor
break down? What exactly are the assets, portfolios, and investors in the
financial metaphor? Further, in a changing world how might one invest in
different kinds of ecological portfolios? Is the metaphor precise enough to
generate ecological portfolio indices and use portfolio theory to actively
manage or conserve ecological systems? And how might the differences between
financial and ecological data affect our ability to apply financial portfolio
theory to ecology? Are ecological portfolios just another name for existing
ecological theory? Or, can ecological portfolios act as a unifying lens
through which we view a wide variety of ecological theory?

Here, we address these questions by reviewing the rapidly emerging literature
on ecological portfolios. The purpose of our review is fourfold: (1) Review
the three recent contrasting applications of ecological portfolios as
metaphors, metrics, and management tools. (2) Illustrate how ecological
portfolios can act as a unifying lens though which we can view a wide variety
of modern ecological theory. (3) Highlight the imprecision of the metaphor
given how we invest in financial and ecological portfolios and how data from
the two fields differ. (4) Emphasize the utility of portfolio optimization
for conservation prioritization.

# Ecological portfolios as a metaphor

- Metaphors can powerfully shape how we perceive scientific ideas
  [@larson2011].
- Ecology has long recognized the benefit of "not putting all your eggs in one
  basket".
- For example, the IUCN Criterion B2a recognizes the risks associated with a
  species existing in a single location [@iucn2001].
- The metaphor is pervasive on its own but also forms the basis for the
  portfolio-effect metric and portfolio management.

Ecologists have used a portfolio metaphor to mean "don't put all your eggs in
one basket" for decades [REFs] although the metaphor has come into particular
prominence in the last 5-10 years [REFs]. Commonly, ecologists have suggested
the need for a portfolio of possible solutions [@ehrlich2008] or approaches
as a bet hedging strategy [REFs]. Ecologists have also used the metaphor to
loosely refer to diverse ecosystems as portfolios of species [REFs]. These
applications are an appealing way to convey concepts of diversification,
uncertainty, and risk to the public in familiar terminology. On the surface
the metaphor seems intuitive, however recent studies have pressed the metaphor
further [@moore2010; @schindler2010; @halpern2011; @ando2012] and the question
remains how far we can take the metaphor before it breaks down [@anderson2013].

# The portfolio-effect metric

- Many recent studies have applied the metaphor quantitatively to ask exactly
  how much of a stabilizing benefit ecological systems get because they exist
  as a diversified portfolio [@greene2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011;
  @thibaut2012; @kasperski2013; @thibaut2013; @anderson2013].
- See Box 1: What is an ecological metric and what makes for a useful
  ecological metric?

Beyond the metaphor, the portfolio effect index asks what the precise benefit
is of a unit increase in biodiversity. We derive the portfolio effect
index from the economic question: How much better off are you by investing
your money in a diversified portfolio instead of investing all your money
in a single asset [@markowitz1952]? In ecology, we consider the current
ecological system the diversified portfolio and a theoretical homogenous (or
monoculture) system the single asset. For example, we could ask how much
more stable a metapopulation of salmon from different streams, rivers, or
watersheds (the portfolio) is compared to a theoretical homogenous stream
population (the single asset [@schindler2010; @carlson2011]. Hence, to
accurately measure a portfolio effect we need to predict the variability of a
theoretical homogenous system --- a system without the element of biodiversity
we are actually interested in. Unfortunately, although the portfolio
metaphor provides a new lens through which to view the diversity-stability
relationship, on its own it provides few new insights about the nature of the
relationship.

Nonetheless, by providing a new lens, the portfolio effect as an index
has provided an impetus for new theoretical and empirical insights into
stability-diversity relationships. Early work focused on theoretical aspects
of the portfolio effect identifying when we would expect a stabilizing
portfolio effect and what factors would enhance it [@doak1998; @tilman1998;
@lehman2000]. Over time theoretical studies developed indices that relaxed
assumptions about the systems they describe [@loreau2010a; @thibaut2013].
Integrating numerous theories from the last decade, @thibaut2013 reduced
the portfolio effect to a weighted-average effect of variability and a
synchrony effect. A recent trend has been to apply these indices to empirical
data [@greene2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011], albeit primarily to
salmon. Empirical work has, however, concentrated on applying relatively
straightforward portfolio effect indices that make strong assumptions that are
rarely met in empirical systems [@thibaut2013]. Violation of these assumptions
can strongly distort our perception of the portfolio effect and hence the
benefit of diversity to ecological stability [@anderson2013].

# Ecological portfolio management

- The extension to measuring the portfolio-effect metric is to manage
  ecological systems using modern portfolio theory mean-variance optimization
  [@crowe2008; @hyytiainen2008; @sanchirico2008; @ando2011; @halpern2011;
  @moloney2011; @ando2012].
- See Figure 1: An introduction to Modern Portfolio Theory mean-variance
  optimization.

Beyond the portfolio effect as an index, we can use financial portfolio theory
to direct ecological resource management. We see this happening in one of
three ways: (1) considering and promoting existing management structures that
promote diversified portfolios, (2) using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to
optimize ecological resource extraction, and (3) using MPT to optimize an
ecological system itself. Markowitz's [REF] seminal contribution to financial
portfolio theory was the concentration on a portfolio selection --- the idea
that there are suites of possible portfolios that can optimize a risk-return
trade-offs. Goals of ecological resource management often parallel those of
financial managers, even though they aren't expressed as such [Figge REF].

First, we can consider existing management structures that create systems
analogous to diversified portfolios. For example, fishers can engage in
catch-pooling cooperatives where fishers share the profits from their catches
according to pre-defined rules. (Sethi et al. 2012a) showed that this
portfolio-like scheme reduces risk for red king crab fishers in the Bering
Sea by up to 40%. Other fisheries management tools such as community-based
management, individual transferable quotas (ITQs), and licensing systems
that allow for fishing a diversity of species can create diversified catch
portfolios for fishers buffering them against the risk of poor profits
(Hilborn et al. 2001; Kasperski & Holland 2013). ANOTHER NON-FISHING EXAMPLE

Second, we can use MPT directly to optimally allocate harvesting efforts. This
suggestion is not new --- some of the earliest references to ecological
portfolios suggest portfolio theory as a management tool [@baldursson1997;
@costanza2000 but few studies have explored the idea to its full extent
and interest in the topic has expanded strongly recently [@edwards2004;
@sanchirico2008; @ando2011; @halpern2011; @ando2012]. In ecology, portfolio
optimization can also be applied spatially. For example, @halpern2011 used MPT
to maximize fishing profits while minimizing spatial unevenness.

- forestry has focussed on MPT for harvesting decisions since the 1980s
  [@hyytiainen2008]

- @hildebrandt2011 used MPT to decide whether forest owners should clearcut or
  retaining standing trees

- @edwards2004 "portfolio management of wild fish stocks"

- [@hyytiainen2008] clearcut or retain standing trees

- MPT as a method to achieve quantitative ecosystem-based fishery management
  [@sanchirico2008]

- Portfolio optimization of grazing animals for Australia's rangelands @moloney2011

Mention that these are almost all fisheries and forestry examples, with one
farming example. Third, we can use ecological portfolio management to choose
how we allocate conservation efforts to manage risk for an ecological system
as a whole. For example, portfolio optimization could be used to allocate
conservation activity for wetlands to maximize ecosystem services while
minimizing uncertainty due to climate change [@ando2011; @ando2012]. In
forestry, MPT has been used to select the optimal weighting of seed sources
for regenerating forests under a variety of climate change scenarios
@crowe2008. We revisit this topic in the Opportunities section of this paper.

# Ecological theory to draw from

- Portfolio theory is both a new lens though which to view many other
  ecological theories and the glue that can hold together many ecological
  theories.

- For example, the theory of island biogeography, metapopulation dynamics, and
  functional-group ecology can all generate portfolio-like ecological
  structure.

- Further, a variety of mechanisms could generate ecological portfolio
  diversification: intraspecific trait variation [@bolnick2011], response
  diversity [@elmqvist2003; @loreau2013], personality variation [@wolf2012],
  biocomplexity [@hutchinson2008], diversity of competitive interactions
  [@mougi2012], complementarity of function [@gonzalez2009].

- see Table 1: Selected ecological theories and their relevance to ecological
  portfolios.

- Pull out interesting points from the table and elaborate on.

- Generally, there's a need to draw from across these disciplines; they often
  stay within their own niche; often, different names exist for the same
  concept and researchers may not discover parallel branches of research.

- For example, the Moran effect identifies that ecological assets that are
  closer together may provide less diversification for a portfolio since they
  will experience more similar environments.

- The theories presented here often address elements of ecological theory, and
  have done so for decades in detail, but may use different terminology. The
  strength of ecological portfolio theory is that it encourages us to consider
  all these elements in conjunction.

# Challenges of applying the metaphor

## Precision of the metaphor

- With financial portfolios we can easily adjust our investment in assets by
  buying and selling and most portfolio theory is developed around this model.
- However the way we invest in many ecological portfolios is different --- we
  invest in the entirety of each asset (say an entire stream of salmon) and it
  can be difficult to change our investment (say increase our investment in
  that stream of salmon through habitat restoration).
- We will explore the literature on different kinds of assets, investors,
  investment styles, and types of diversification for ecological portfolios and
  their implications for applying portfolio theory.
- For example, papers have considered investment as shark habitat [@yates2012],
  salmon abundance [@greene2010; @moore2010; @schindler2010; @carlson2011], and
  protected-area size [@ando2012].

## A case study to illustrate the complexity

- Focus on how there are multiple investors for the same ecological assets with
  often-conflicting goals and different ways of managing their investment.
- see Figure \ref{fig:salmonport}: Components of ecological portfolios
  (included at end of document).

## Attributes of financial and ecological data

Ecological and financial data differ in many fundamental ways that will affect
how financial portfolio theory can be applied to ecological systems (Table
\ref{tab:data}). For example, ecological data is often of short duration,
recorded at low frequency (e.g. each year), and often contains missing
values. Financial data, on the other hand, can be recorded every minute for
decades and rarely contains missing values. Financial statistics that depend
on such data may not be applicable to ecological data. As another example,
ecological data often includes considerable measurement error that adds
uncertainty to inferences about the "value" of ecological assets. Financial
stock returns, however, by definition reflect the trading value of a stock,
even if they do not reflect the underlying state of the company. Therefore, to
accurately apply financial portfolio optimization to ecological portfolios, we
may need to adopt methods that incorporate measurement error. Solutions may
include Bayesian modelling, Monte Carlo simulation, and state space models.

# Opportunities

## Ecological portfolio optimization

A central focus of financial portfolio theory is selecting an optimal
weighting of assets to maximize return for a given level of risk or minimize
risk for a given level of return [@markowitz1952]. In this paper, we
have discussed optimizing ecological resource use to improve the income
of ecological resource harvesters. However, we have mentioned only two
examples of portfolio optimization to benefit a purely conservation outcome
[@crowe2008; @ando2012]. We suggest taking the ecological portfolio management
concept to its logical extension: consider optimizing portfolios of ecological
assets with the goal of maximizing ecological productivity while minimizing
the risk of low productivity Figure \ref{fig:mpt}.

Any ecological scenario that produces time series analogous to typical
financial stock time series may be a candidate for ecological conservation
portfolio optimization. Population growth rate within a metapopulation
context is one possibility and will generally represent a stationary time
series in the same way that the first difference of returns are frequently
used in financial portfolio analysis [REF]. The central issue with applying
conservation-oriented ecological portfolio optimization will be deciding what
precisely constitutes "investment" and how that investment re-allocation
will occur. For example, if the abundance of subpopulations is considered
investment how does one increase or decrease that investment through
time? Perhaps these adjustments could be made through changes in harvesting
limits, stock supplementation, or habitat restoration. Realistic re-investment
strategies may be taxa, region, or case-specific, but are thus far mostly
unexplored.

## Ecological risk metrics

Ecology has typically used metrics of symmetric variability such as the
standard deviation or the coefficient of variation of a time series [e.g.
@greene2010] and sometimes loosely referred to the result as risk; but, risk
specifically refers both to the probability of something "undesired" happening
and the magnitude of that event [@rachev2008]. For example, if an outcome
is unknown but can only end positively, it presents no risk. Therefore,
ecological risk metrics should allow for an asymmetry in this "desirableness"
or loss function [@reckhow1994]. Further, recent work in ecology has noted
the frequency and influence of "ecological surprises" [@lindenmayer2010;
@doak2012] and counterintuitive responses of populations to management
[@pine-iii2009]. Therefore, like financial risk metrics, ecological risk
metrics should allow for fat-tailed probability distributions. The financial
literature is rich with methods to rapidly assess the risk properties of time
series --- methods that are particularly useful when used as part of portfolio
optimization [@rachev2008].

Recent financial literature has focused on downside risk metrics [@ang2006],
which emphasize the probability of an "undesired" event; we see great
opportunity for their application in ecology. A variety of downside risk
metrics measure different properties of risk. Therefore, how do different
risk metrics reflect the goals of different "investors" in ecological
portfolios? Conservation organizations, for example, may be concerned with
avoiding catastrophic single years that could influence future productivity
or have down-stream effects on predators or prey. They might, for example,
use the probability of ruin, which measures the probability of an event
worse than some threshold occurring [@vasicek1987] or the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) [@rockafellar2002; @sethi2012a; @sethi2012b] to
characterize the average magnitude of an extremely bad event. Resource users,
on the other hand, might wish to minimize year-to-year fluctuations to ensure
a stable income. Their interests could be reflected in the semideviation
or semivariance, which characterizes a typical bad event [@markowitz1959;
@sethi2012a; @sethi2012b]. Moving forward, a fruitful area of research may be
matching risk metrics to specific resource-management goals [@sethi2012a].

<!--Risk refers both to the probability of something "undesired" happening and the magnitude of that event [@rachev2008].-->
<!--Metrics such as the coefficient of variation can not capture the combination of these properties, but financial downside risk metrics can.-->
<!--Exemplifying the need for proper risk metrics in ecology, recent papers have focused on the frequency of ecological surprises [@lindenmayer2010; @doak2012].-->
<!--The financial literature increasingly relies on downside risk metrics [@ang2006] and the fisheries literature has begun applying these metrics to resource management [@sethi2012; @sethi2012a].-->
<!--There is tremendous opportunity to match risk metrics to resource-management goals.-->

# Outlook

There are many future questions for ecological portfolio theory. For
example: Across taxa, geography, and time, how pervasive is the stabilizing
ecological portfolio effect? What drives the ecological portfolio effect and
how can we promote it? How can the portfolio effect and portfolio optimization
inform management and conservation and in what other contexts can it be
applied? For example, how might they inform the debate about single large
or several small reserves (SLOSS) debate? How can we integrate established
principles of ecological and resource management with portfolio theory? What
can financial portfolio theory tell us about managing for recovery? How can we
move ecological portfolio theory beyond an academic exercise to applying its
principles in applied management?

<!--# Concluding remarks-->
<!--[Notes] Important to think about ecological portfolios from all aspects --- metaphors, indices, and management tools. Management, in particular, is an exciting area of research that we have just scraped the surface of.-->
<!--Lots of potential assets and investors and different investment styles, but we need to careful consider how our metaphor affects quantitative aspects of our analysis.-->
<!--We need to be careful of a number of potential pitfalls including imprecision in the metaphor and fundamental differences in the types of data we're working with.-->
<!--Ecological portfolio theory is useful in that it brings together many aspects of ecological theory, risk, uncertainty, and variance. However, we need to be careful not to re-invent the wheel and instead use ecological portfolio theory as the glue that holds these theories together in a way that's useful to management, and that conveys the salient concepts clearly to the public and resource managers.-->
