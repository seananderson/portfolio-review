# Causes and consequences of ecological portfolios

## Ecological portfolios

- Communities
- Theory of Island Biogeography
- Metapopulations
- Functional groups
- (Also: meta-communities...)

## Harvesting portfolios

- Metapopulation aggregation (e.g. salmon fishing at mouth of stream)
- Species aggregation (e.g. hunting or fishing multiple species)
- Planting multiple species of a similar crop

## Issues to touch on

- uni vs. multidimensional issue
  - solutions: utility theory, multiple optimizations, or consider as one part of the decision making process
