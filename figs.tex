\centering \includegraphics[width=5in]{salmon-portfolios.pdf} \caption{\textbf{There
  are multiple ways of investing in ecological portfolios.} In this example,
  investors are shown along the top and bottom and ecological assets are shown
  in the middle (populations of chum salmon, \textit{Oncorhynchus keta}, and
  Chinook salmon, \textit{Oncorhynchus tshawytscha}). The shaded arcs indicate
  investment. \textbf{(a)} Partial-asset investors invest by removing portions
  of the salmon populations --- the salmon that commercial fisher 1 removes are
  unavailable for the grizzly bear. These investors can often change their
  investment with ease. For example, commercial fisher 2 could decide to fish
  more Chinook and less chum salmon. Most financial portfolio theory is
  developed around this paradigm. \textbf{(b)} Whole-asset investors invest in
  entire populations. These investors can share assets but may have different
  goals for their portfolio. They can adjust their investment by managing
  properties of the population itself. For example, the fisheries management
  agency could reduce fishing of chum salmon to allow the population to grow.
  The conservation agency could fund habitat restoration for Chinook salmon to
  increase carrying capacity and expand their investment.}

  \textbf{Symmetric vs.\ downside risk measures.} \textbf{(Left panel)} An
  illustration of rate of change of abundance (``returns'' in financial
  terminology) for three theoretical populations with low, medium, and high
  downside risk but equal variance. The dark blue line represents the mean and
  the blue shaded region represents $\pm$ one standard deviation --- a measure
  that does not account for the assymetric property of risk. The red line
  represents the 95\% CVaR (conditional value at risk) and the red shaded
  region represents the region below the 95\% VaR (value at risk).
  \textbf{(Right panel)} \textbf{(a)} Symmetric and downside risk metrics
  applied to annual returns of sockeye salmon stocks in the Fraser River.
  Stocks are ordered by increased CVaR. \textbf{(b)} The portfolio effect
  calculated for the same salmon stocks using the four risk metrics. Lines
  connect at the portfolio effect value and the vertical segments show the
  interquartile range.} \label{fig:risk}
