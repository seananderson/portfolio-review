-   With financial portfolios we can easily adjust our investment in assets by
buying and selling and most portfolio theory is developed around this model.
-   However the way we invest in many ecological portfolios is different --- we
invest in the entirety of each asset (say an entire stream of salmon) and it
can be difficult to change our investment (say increase our investment in that
stream of salmon through habitat restoration).
-   We will explore the literature on different kinds of assets, investors,
investment styles, and types of diversification for ecological portfolios and
their implications for applying portfolio theory.
-   For example, papers have considered investment as shark habitat
[@yates2012], salmon abundance [@greene2010; @moore2010; @schindler2010;
@carlson2011], and protected-area size [@ando2012].

<!--Risk refers both to the probability of something "undesired" happening and
  the magnitude of that event [@rachev2008].-->
<!--Metrics such as the coefficient of variation can not capture the
  combination of these properties, but financial downside risk metrics can.-->
<!--Exemplifying the need for proper risk metrics in ecology, recent papers
  have focused on the frequency of ecological surprises [@lindenmayer2010; @doak2012].-->
<!--The financial literature increasingly relies on downside risk metrics
  [@ang2006] and the fisheries literature has begun applying these metrics to resource management [@sethi2012; @sethi2012a].-->
<!--There is tremendous opportunity to match risk metrics to
  resource-management goals.-->
